# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Auto-detect TikTok cookies from Firefox** — the tool now automatically
  reads `sessionid_ss` and `tt-target-idc` from Firefox's cookie store
  (`~/.mozilla/firefox/*/cookies.sqlite`) using bun:sqlite. Falls back to
  `cookies.json` if Firefox isn't available or no TikTok login session is
  found. No CLI flags, no config changes, no extra dependencies required.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **False-offline detection** — when TikTok asynchronously loads room info,
  `LiveRoom.liveRoomUserInfo` could be absent from SIGI_STATE, causing the tool
  to incorrectly report a live user as offline. Added a three-tier fallback:
  `UserModule.users[user].roomId` for the room ID, `LiveRoom.liveRoomStatus`
  for live status, and Webcast API (`room/enter/` and `room/info/`) as the final
  resort for stream URL extraction.
- **TypeScript `process` global not found** — `tsconfig.json` was missing the
  `"types": ["bun"]` field, so VS Code and standalone `tsc` could not resolve
  Bun-provided Node.js globals without installing `@types/node`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Positional username** — `tokrec vierstinrovve` now works in addition to
  `--user vierstinrovve` and `-u vierstinrovve`. The first bare argument is
  treated as the TikTok username.
- **Comprehensive README** — full documentation covering CLI options, library
  API, authentication setup, pipeline architecture, event system, FAQ, and
  troubleshooting.

### Changed

- **Version source of truth** — the CLI tool now reads its version dynamically
  from `package.json` via `pkg.version`, instead of a hardcoded string. One
  less thing to update on release.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Package renamed** — `tiktok-live-recorder-bun` → `@zfadhli/tokrec` for npm publishing
  under the `@zfadhli` scope. Binary name stays `tiktok-live-recorder`.
- **Publish via GitHub Actions** — the `publish.yml` workflow now runs `npm publish
  --provenance --access public` on `v*` tags, using the `NPM_TOKEN` secret. Provenance
  attestation is enabled for supply-chain transparency.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Terminal Display Manager** (`src/ui.ts`) — replaces cluttered `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL]`
  console output with a beautiful spinner-driven terminal UI using koko-cli's
  `createSpinner`, `ICON_*`, and `color` utilities.
- **Live progress during recording** — spinner shows current bytes downloaded, elapsed
  time, and download speed (e.g. `150.2 MB • 1m 23s • 1.8 MB/s`), updated every second.
- **Automatic stream reconnection** — TikTok stream segments are short-lived (30-60s).
  When one ends, the downloader transparently fetches a fresh URL and continues writing
  to the same file. `--duration` limits work correctly across reconnections.
- **Reconnection safety limits** — max 100 reconnects per recording session prevents
  infinite loops if TikTok returns endless redirects.
- **New recorder events** — `checking`, `download:progress`, `download:end`,
  `segmenting:start`, `segmenting:end`, `converting:start` for fine-grained lifecycle
  tracking.
- **`logConsole` config option** — set `false` to suppress internal logger console output
  (used automatically by the CLI when the Display is active).

### Changed

- **CLI output** — replaced all `[INFO]`/`[WARN]`/`[ERROR]` log lines with clean
  one-liners using ✔/✘/⚠/ℹ icons and colored text. File logs remain fully detailed with
  timestamps and levels for debugging.
- **Logger `console` option** — `createLogger()` now accepts `console: boolean` (default
  `true`). When `false`, writes to file only, allowing the Display to own the terminal.
- **Stream downloader signature** — `download()` accepts an optional `getNextUrl`
  callback and `ProgressInfo` callback. Existing callers using 4 params continue to work.

### Fixed

- **Premature end of recording** — TikTok delivers live streams as short FLV segments
  (30-60s). Previously, the downloader stopped at the end of the first segment and
  waited 3+ minutes for the next poll. Now it reconnects transparently and keeps
  recording to the same file.
- **Spinner/label interleaving** — the internal logger was writing to stdout while the
  Display was also using the terminal, causing raw `[INFO]` lines between spinner
  frames. Now the Display is the sole owner of stdout/stderr in CLI mode.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Split into library + CLI dual entry point** — `createRecorder` and all types are
  now exported from the package entry (`'tiktok-live-recorder-bun'`), while the CLI
  is available at `'tiktok-live-recorder-bun/cli'`. The `tiktok-live-recorder` binary
  continues to work unchanged.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **SIGI_STATE HTML scraping** — extract room ID, live status, and stream URLs from the
  TikTok profile page's embedded JSON. No Webcast API dependency needed.
- **Recursive stream URL search** — brute-force FLV/HLS URL search across the entire
  SIGI_STATE JSON, surviving TikTok key name or nesting structure changes.
- **JSON string parsing in recursive search** — handles nested JSON-encoded fields (like
  `stream_data`) by recursively parsing and searching inside them.
- **All quality key fallback** — tries `origin`, `fhd`, `uhd`, `hd`, `sd`, `ld` quality
  keys instead of only `hd`/`ld`.
- **Webcast API fallback** — when SIGI_STATE lacks stream data (async-loaded room info),
  falls back to `/webcast/room/info/?aid=1988` with recursive search on the response.
- **Cookie-based auth seeding** — seeds TikTok session cookies into the HTTP session jar
  via `session.setCookie()` for authenticated requests.
- **Chrome TLS fingerprint impersonation** — uses `wreq-js` with `chrome_142` profile
  to bypass basic bot detection.
- **Automatic polling mode** — polls every N minutes (configurable, default 5), records
  when user goes live.
- **Custom recording duration** — `--duration` flag to stop recording after N seconds.
- **Custom output directory** — `--output` flag for recording destination.
- **FLV → MP4 auto-conversion** — spawns FFmpeg with stream copy (`-c copy`, no re-encode)
  after recording completes, deletes the original FLV.
- **HTTP proxy support** — `--proxy` flag for regional restriction bypass.
- **Rotating log files** — 5 MB rotating file logger (3 backups) + color console output.
- **Graceful shutdown** — Ctrl-C aborts download, flushes buffer, converts to MP4, and
  cleans up. Second Ctrl-C force-terminates.
- **35 automated tests** — covering CLI parsing, config validation, logger, recursive
  search edge cases (deep nesting, JSON strings, arrays, quality key variants).

### Fixed

- **WAF blocking bypass** — TikTok's Slardar WAF blocked unauthenticated requests.
  Fixed by seeding cookies into the session via `setCookie()` instead of sending a
  one-off `Cookie` header that wasn't persisted.
- **Deadlock on Ctrl-C during recording** — `monitor.stop()` waited for the in-flight
  tick but never awaited `currentTick` because the promise wasn't assigned. Fixed by
  properly tracking the tick promise and awaiting it in `stop()`.
- **Stream download not aborting on Ctrl-C** — `reader.read()` blocked indefinitely
  even after `abortFlag` was set. Fixed by calling `reader.cancel()` in `abort()`.
- **No timeout on HTTP requests** — `session.fetch()` hung forever on hanging
  connections. Fixed by adding `AbortSignal.timeout(15000)` to all requests.
- **Network errors crashing the tick loop** — `fetchLiveInfo` now returns `null` on
  timeout/error instead of throwing, so the tick handler cleanly logs "offline".
